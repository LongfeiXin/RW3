        "abstract": "Transit agencies in major cities make hundreds of decisions every day on how to best allocate scarce resources. How adequate and reliable is service on a given bus route? When should capacity be added to a popular route? How should a bus route serve a neighborhood? Transit planners make decisions by using whatever information is available. This information includes ground surveys, public feedback, and a large element of experience and intuition. This paper presents BusViz, a web-based application that helps bus service operators and transit regulators to make better decisions by using large streams of field data to monitor and visualize the performance of bus fleets. The paper describes the system architecture and user interface of the application and illustrates how the Singapore Land Transport Authority is using it to iterate and evaluate ideas with data-driven rigor and to share quality of service statistics with various stakeholders.",

        "abstract": "Public transportation is an effective method of mobility that promotes cost-saving and is environmentally friendly. Poor public transport ridership in Malaysia is due to the unsatisfactory attitude of public transport users and inaccurate information on departure and arrivals. Sarawak, a state of Malaysia, is especially poor in ridership of public transport. A real-time Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking application (app) was found to be an effective tool to increase the ridership of public transport. Hence, a mobile app named UniBus was developed to enhance the ridership of public transport in Sarawak. The determinants that affect satisfaction and customer loyalty such as accessibility, reliability, comfort, safety, and security were all examined before and after the use of real-time GPS tracking app. The data was collected in Kuching, and targeted public transport users who used the UniBus app. The result indicated that all the mentioned variables were improved after using a real-time GPS tracking app. It is suggested that future studies can consider other factors such as service quality, availability, and perceived value as well as cover other states of Malaysia.",

        "abstract": "Evaluation of the quality of service (QoS) of public city buses is generally performed using surveys that assess attributes such as accessibility, availability, comfort, convenience, reliabilities, safety, security, etc. Each survey attribute is assessed from the subjective viewpoint of the service users. This is reliable and straightforward because the consumer is the one who accesses the bus service. However, in addition to summarizing personal feedback from humans, using data analytics has become another useful method for assessing the QoS of bus transportation. This work aims to use global positioning system (GPS) data to measure the reliability, accessibility, and availability of bus transportation services. There are three QoS scoring functions for tracking complete trips, on-path driving, and on-schedule operation. In the analytical process, GPS coordinates rounding is adopted and applied for detecting trips on each route path. After assessing the three QoS scores, it has been found that most bus routes have good operations with high scores, while some bus routes show room for improvement. Future work could use our data to create recommendations for policy makers in terms of how to improve a city's smart mobility.",

        "abstract": "\u25ba We review data management systems for a large scale application \u2013 London\u2019s iBus. \u25ba With 8000 buses, we illustrate the range of applications to improve bus operations. \u25ba From bus priority to dynamic bus fleet management, we show the potential of iBus. \u25ba We show how bus dwell times at stops can be obtained automatically from iBus data. Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) Systems are being introduced increasingly in many major cities around the world to improve the efficiency of our road-based passenger transport systems. Satellite-based location and communication systems, particularly the Global Positioning System (GPS) have been the platform for AVL systems which are now supporting real-time passenger information (RTPI), fleet management and operations (FMOs) and public transport priorities (PTPs), to name three key applications. The process of real-time on-board bus location can result in a substantial database where the progress of the bus is stored typically on a second-by-second basis. This is necessary for the primary real-time applications such as those listed above (e.g. RTPI, FMO and PTP). In addition, it is clear that such data could have an array of \u2018secondary\u2019 purposes, including use off-line for improving scheduling efficiency and for automatic performance monitoring, thus reducing or removing the need for manual on-street surveys. This paper looks at these and other innovative uses of AVL data for public transport, taking the recent iBus system in London as a current example of a modern AVL/GPS application in a capital city. It describes the data architecture and management in iBus and then illustrates two further examples of secondary data use \u2013 dwell time estimation and bus performance analysis. The paper concludes with a discussion of some key data management issues, including data quantity and quality, before drawing conclusions.",

        "abstract": "A reliable public transport system plays an important role in reducing energy consumption, carbon emission, road congestion and increasing urban operating efficiency. However, the reliability of public transport systems in some cities is facing the pressure of population and urban expansion, making it unattractive to passengers and leading to a higher level of car dependency. This paper focuses on Birmingham's bus service reliability and potential factors affecting bus travel delay based on the 63 bus route operational data in Birmingham. This study is conducted by doing data processing, bus travel time distribution analysis and, bus travel time delay causes analysis. For the analysis, models are developed by using Stata software. 12 variables are considered to estimate the bus delay. This study applies a regression technique to develop models. The results of bus travel time distribution analyses show the average bus travel time is behind schedule. The results of regression models show departure delay, number of signalised intersections, number of pedestrian crossing phases, and distance between stops are factors affecting bus travel delay. At the route level, the results show parades and roadworks could increase bus travel time delay while protests and rainfall have no significant effect and road accidents could sometimes impact bus travel time delay. Finally, it is recommended that a tighter bus on-time performance monitoring scheme should be applied to let drivers know the delay status of the bus and safely allow drivers to drive at a higher speed. Transit signal priority (TSP) techniques are also applicable but it needs detectors and traffic signals to be equipped on buses to give priority for buses at the intersection. Lastly, alternative diversion plans can also be provided in case of any predictable and unpredictable road closures. This is for being sent to passengers to assist passengers' decision-making. \u2022The delay risk analysis has been undertaken to establish causal model of bus transit.\u2022Urban bus service reliability has been conducted using actual 63 bus route operational data in Birmingham city.\u2022Departure delay, number of signalised intersections, and distance between stops are examples of factors affecting bus travel delay.\u2022Potentially, parades and roadworks could increase bus travel time delay.\u2022Surprisingly, protests and rainfall have no significant effect.",

This study aims to extract the potential bus lines and each line's passenger density of CCBS by mining the public transport big data. The datasets used in this study are mainly Smart Card Data (SCD) and bus GPS data of Qingdao, China, from October 11th and November 7th 2015. Firstly, we compute the temporal-origin-destination (TOD) of passengers by mining SCD and bus GPS data. Compared with the traditional OD, TOD not only has the spatial location, but also contains the trip's boarding time. Secondly, based on the traditional DBSCAN algorithm, we put forwards an algorithm, named TOD-DBSCAN, combined with the spatial-temporal features of TOD.TOD-DBSCAN is used to cluster the TOD trajectories in peak hours of all working days. Then, we define two variables P and N to describe the possibility and passenger destiny of a potential CCBS line. P is the probability of the CCBS line. And N represents the potential passenger destiny of the line. Lastly, we visualize the potential CCBS lines extracted by our procedure on the map and analyse relationship between potential CCBS lines and the urban spatial structure.",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, a growing international trend has been the implementation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as a cost-effective way to enhance urban public transport (UPT) service quality and progress towards sustainable urban transport. To date, in excess of 40 cities worldwide operate BRT within their UPT networks. Despite the international prominence of BRT systems, there has been limited in-depth investigation of their spatial-temporal dynamics. Drawing on a case study BRT system, Brisbane, Australia, we apply a geo-visualisation-based method to a large smart card database to examine spatial-temporal dynamics. The conditional flow-maps (or flow-comaps) are created to visually compare the spatial trajectories of BRT trips and other bus-based trips and their variation by calendar events (i.e., a workday, a weekend, a school holiday and a public holiday). The results highlight (1) marked differences between BRT-based trips to those bus trips undertaken on the broader UPT network; (2) spatial heterogeneity in BRT trips; and (3) the potential of drawing on \u2018big data\u2019 to support evidence-based BRT planning. These findings render important implications with the capacity to inform future BRT strategy as it relates to service management and infrastructure expansion. \u2022A geo-visualisation method was applied to a big dataset to examine bus trip dynamics.\u2022Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) trips differ from the rest of bus trips in spatial-temporal patterns.\u2022Spatial heterogeneity of passenger trip patterns using the BRT busway was revealed.\u2022Findings may inform future service management and busway expansion of BRT system.",

        "abstract": "Urban bus networks play an important role, when the capacity of urban public services is evaluated. With recent advancements in Internet and Communication Technologies, there is an emerging interest in building an urban bus network model through open big data. This has rarely been investigated and exposes several challenges in the provision of transportation services in urban planning. On the one hand, it is necessary to combine bus stations based on spatial distance constraints due to their ambiguous definition in open big data; on the other hand, it is difficult and time-consuming to relocate and build new stations, but the optimization of bus lines is relatively easy to implement. This study aimed to develop an explicit methodological framework for building and analyzing two different types of urban bus network model using open big data. Thereafter, the framework was applied in two case studies in China, within a county-level administration and in a region including three county-level administrations. The key result shows that there was a shortage of urban bus services across these different administrations. This paper contributes to the body of research methodologies into public transport networks and to understanding the sharing of urban public services across administrations, improving the management of urban bus networks, and highlighting the importance of examining the characteristics of urban bus network in county-level administrations rather than just in large cities in China.",
